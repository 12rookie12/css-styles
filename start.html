            Development of Tumblr began in 2006 during a two-week gap between contracts at David Karp's software 
            consulting company, Davidville.[3][4] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs, hence 
            the name Tumblr)[5] for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms 
            to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As none had done so after a year of waiting,
             Karp and developer Marco Arment began working on their own platform.[6][7] Tumblr was launched in February 
             2007,[8][9] and within two weeks had gained 75,000 users.[10] Arment left the company in September 2010 to work on Instapaper
